CUYAMACA COLLEGE COURSE OUTLINE OF RECORD

COMPUTER SCIENCE 182 – INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING

3 hours lecture, 3 hours laboratory, 4 units

Catalog Description

` `Introductory course in the basics of the Java programming language focusing on object oriented methodology. Topics include classes, methods, parameters, arrays, modularity, abstraction, exception handling, and stream and file I/O. In addition to writing and using new classes, students will utilize theAWT and/or Swing libraries of classes. Basic inheritance and mobile application programming areintroduced.

Prerequisite

“C” grade or higher or “Pass” in MATH 110 or equivalent

Recommended Preparation

“C” grade or higher or “Pass” in CS 119 or equivalent or experience programming in C++ or Java

Course Objectives

Given a programming project scenario, students will be able to:1) Summarize the evolution of programming languages illustrating how this history has led to the paradigms available today.

\2) Write well-designed, modularized Java programs to solve a variety of scientific problems as applets or standalone programs\.

\3) Select appropriate storage class characteristics for variables, objects and methods and justify the reason(s) for the selection\.

\4) Solve a variety of programming problems using sound structured, top-down, object-oriented design principles\.

\5) Use inheritance to minimize reinvention of similar objects\.6) Access standard Java library modules\.

\7) Explain the difference between (and implications of) reference vs\. primitive data types\. 8) Design, create and utilize complex classes and their associated objects\. 9) Input and output data to and from standard devices and files\.

\10) Visualize array subscripting as memory offset calculations and explain some of the implications\. Represent this visualization in drawings\.

\11) Utilize fundamental program control structures (sequence, decision, and repetition)\. 12) Utilize the try-throw-catch approach to exception handling\. 13) Code efficient sort and search algorithms\.

\14) Identify the scope of a Java variable in a program\.

\15) Demonstrate in a program the use of a method that returns an array\.16) Trace program flow and predict outcomes\.

\17) Program mobile applications

Method of Evaluation

A grading system will be established by the instructor and implemented uniformly. Grades will bebased on demonstrated proficiency in subject matter determined by multiple measurements forevaluation, one of which must be essay exams, skills demonstration or, where appropriate, the symbolsystem.

\1) Quizzes and exams that measure students’ ability to use programming terminology and explain technical concepts related to program development and implementation in Java\.

\2) Practical exams that measure students’ ability to trace programming code to predict outcome\. 3) Projects that measure students’ ability to write complete application programs demonstrating effective use of object-oriented principles, methodology and concepts\.
